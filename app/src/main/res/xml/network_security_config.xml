    <!--
        Cleartext (HTTP) is permitted because many Parseable instances are
        self-hosted on private networks without TLS. The app defaults to HTTPS
        and shows a security warning in the login screen when the user enables
        the "Allow insecure" toggle.

        Note: Android's domain-config with includeSubdomains does NOT support
        IP subnet matching (e.g. 192.168.x.x), so whitelisting private IP
        ranges is not possible via this config. Instead we allow cleartext
        globally and rely on the app-level UI warning.
